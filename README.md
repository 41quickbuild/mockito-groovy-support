Why?
====

You're using Mockito and Groovy. Maybe you've noticed that, when you try to mock a Groovy
class from a Groovy test, it fails horribly. Now it won't!

Specifically, this library provides a workaround for Mockito Issue 303:
http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=303

How do you use it?
==================

1) Include mockito-groovy-support on your classpath.
2) Use Mockito from Groovy as you normally would.
3) Everything should just work. If it doesn't, let us know.

Where can I get it?
===================

[Download the jar](http://m14m.net/mockito-groovy-support-1.1.jar). The new version will be up on Maven when I figure out how.
