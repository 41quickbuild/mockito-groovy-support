Why?
====

You're using Mockito and Groovy. Maybe you've noticed that, when you try to mock a Groovy
class from a Groovy test, it fails horribly. Now it won't!

Specifically, this library provides a workaround for Mockito Issue 303:
http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=303

How do you use it?
==================

1) Include mockito-groovy-support on your classpath.
2) Use Mockito from Groovy as you normally would.
3) Everything should just work. If it doesn't, let us know.

Where can I get it?
===================

Go to the [Downloads tab](https://github.com/cyrusinnovation/mockito-groovy-support/downloads) and download the jar.
